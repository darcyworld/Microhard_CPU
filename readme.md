After playing MRHD, a game in which you design a CPU starting with just a single NAND gate I decided to see if I can clone the CPU in VHDL while adding some feedback and insight in the design of the CPU.
This repository will contain some game spoilers, but no copypaste solutions for MRHD. 

I will try to keep the VHDL in the same style as the MRHD code, so as much stuff build from logic gates, even if it makes the code larger then needed. 

The MHRD game can be bought on steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/576030 and is highly recommended. To fully understand everything in this repo it's probably best to have played MRHD first, so please give it a go :)
